Here, I didn't work on only Jupyter notebook. for the deep understanding what is the Insights of the method I also work same project in Excel, where advance Excel with Pivot tables and chart, I do realize how linear method exactly work with Jupyter Note book and how R2 square, slope, coeeficient value work insight the code.
all the output values are the same in Excel what output of code we are using in the jupyter notebook.
and where exact fit line suited from the dataset, where we are using models in jUpyter notebook.
what we are doing in the jupyter notebook same thing we can do in the Advance excel(just for the deep undersatnding of code and model).
